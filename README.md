# wellhausen

**Wellhausen** is a Python 3 package for distinguishing among multiple authorial voices in a composite text.

## Why 'wellhausen'?

This package is named after the biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen, who proposed that the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch) were a composite document, originating in four separate narratives. He claimed that the four distinct source texts that were stitched together to form the Pentateuch could still be distinguished on the basis of style and vocabulary choice, among other things. The **wellhausen** package aims to collect available techniques for separating composite texts into their authorial components, making the techniques of Wellhausen available for any with an interest in understanding the origins of some of the foundational texts of human history.
